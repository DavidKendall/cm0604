# Introduction


<p class="lead">
This module is designed to serve as an introduction to rigorous methods for specifying, designing and reasoning about embedded systems. The module uses state-of-the-art tools and techniques, including SPIN, UPPAAL and PRISM. It emphasises the importance of constructing and analysing models in the early stages of system development.
</p>

The main ideas are communicated in a series of 12 lectures. The laboratory sessions are used to put these ideas into practice in a variety of modelling and analysis exercises. By the end of the module, you should be able to take an informal specification of an embedded system, construct a formal model of (part of) a design and reason about the likely behaviour of the system. The understanding gained in this process can be invaluable in the implementation of a reliable system.

The principles and techniques taught in this module are used extensively in the module EN0617 Industrial Case Project.

# Synopsis

The aim of the module is to provide an understanding of the theory and practice
of modelling, specification and analysis in the design of embedded systems.

On completion of this module, students will be able to:

1. Evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the application of rigorous methods in the development of embedded systems, and justify their use where appropriate; having regard to professional, technical and security issues.
2. Construct and evaluate rigorous models of a variety of small embedded systems.
3. Compose formal specifications of system properties and analyse system models with respect to them.
4. Identify, apply and evaluate appropriate software tools to support the construction and analysis of rigorous system models and properties.

# Teaching Plan

The following is a *provisional* guide to the organisation of the
module for this year. These arrangements are subject to change during the

<p class="text-info">
In addition to the taught sessions, you are expected to undertake independent
and directed learning. This is a 20-credit module, for which the expected
student workload is 200 hours. Over the course of a 15-week semester, you
should be spending about 13 hours per week on this module.
</p>

# Assessment

Summative assessment comprises:

* a substantial exercise in specification, design and analysis in which students will be required to demonstrate both a practical ability to apply appropriate languages, techniques and tools, and also an understanding of the theoretical principles underlying their practice. This is a single assessment, contributing 100% of the
module mark.

The assessment specification will be made available to students in week 6 and will be discussed in the lab session that week. The work is due to be submitted via the elP (Blackboard) by 23.59 on Thursday of week 12. Feedback and provisional marks will be provided to students by email within 20 working days of submission.

Assessment is subject to the Academic Regulations for Taught Awards. You should ensure that you are familiar with the latest regulations, particularly with regard to academic misconduct and late submission of work.
